PLACEHOLDER IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS

This directory should contain a placeholder image named "placeholder-profile.png"
used as a fallback when a user's profile image is not available.

If this image is missing, the application will display a colored circle with the first
letter of the user's name as a fallback.

Options to create this image:
1. Add a PNG file approximately 150x150 pixels with a neutral profile placeholder
2. Copy an existing image like doctor-placeholder.svg to this location
3. Use a simple logo or icon from your organization

The local asset is preferred over external URLs like placeholder.com because:
- It works offline
- It's faster
- It prevents ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED errors
- It avoids external service dependencies

If you need to recreate this file, please ensure it's placed at:
/assets/placeholder-profile.png
